The “Personal Budget Tracker” program is a personal financial management tool used to track an individual’s current and future cash flow based on their income and expenses and anticipated income and expenses. Users download transaction data as .csv files from the various banking accounts they have, such as their checking, savings, or credit card accounts and paste them into a single custom .csv file and then run a C++ program that reads in the data and provides various beneficial information on it.  It will calculate a running tabulation of all their income and expenses to give the user their current cash flow value.  Users can get historical reports of the monthly totals for each income and expense category they have.  They can see all transactions in a specific month and year, or all transactions for a specific category all-time, as well as a history of their month end cash flow values.  They can create a custom budget template where they enter the expected monthly amounts for their income and expense categories and the program can tell them if they have yet to pay, have met, or have exceeded the expected monthly amount for each category, and will tell them their expected month end cash flow value based on their current transactions and budgeted amounts.  They will also get an alert if they have spent more or earned more in a certain category.  They can also incorporate items they want to save for, and the application can tell them when they are expected to have enough to purchase the item or how much they can afford to pay monthly on it.

Please see Appendices B and C in the [project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-cf_ue1COExs7yJHwRO4eYTnbxouRKp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103709849516774408121&rtpof=true&sd=true) for set up and installation instructions and watch the [video on the data store](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1760KKbHCVGLB1xTt6u1suUfPCyo_FLYK/view?usp=sharing) for additional examples on how to set up the .csv files to run the program. 

#### Main Menu 
Users are greeted with their current cash flow value and projected month end cash flow values as well as notifications on any categories they have exceeded the expected budgeted amount on, and a menu with options to view historical transaction data, set budgeted amounts and compare actual to budgeted expenses, and enter items to save for and timelines for acquiring those items.
